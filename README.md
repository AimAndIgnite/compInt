# Computational Intelligence (ANN for Regression and Classification)

Greetings,

This Jupyter notebook file contains the processes of: 

a. Data Pre-processing
- Removing irrelevant attributes and imputing missing values.

b. Regression Task
- Predicting the amount of violent crimes per population based on the given attributes.

c. Classification Task
- Converting the target attribute "ViolentCrimesPerPop" into 3 classes, and then predicting the classes based on the given attributes.

for the "Communities and Crime Data Set" dataset.

The dataset can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learningdatabases/communities/ 
and its description at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Communities+and+Crime

Cheers!
